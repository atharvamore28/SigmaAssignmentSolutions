    <h1>CSS</h1>
    <p style="background-color: yellow;">CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is the language used to style an HTML file and tell the browser how it should render the elements on the page. CSS lets us move everything presentation-related from the HTML to the CSS so that HTML could get back to being the format that defines the structure of the document, rather than how things should look in the browser.</p>
